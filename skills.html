			<h2><span class='special'>Music Player</span></h2>
			<p>During reading a book I was fascinated by the GUI applications so I thought to build some. After scouring the web for days I thought music player was a good idea. Since, in the book the example was using wxPython I also experimented using it. After days of reading the documentation and experimentation the final result was <a href="https://www.github.com/vaskar-gorai/Music-Player" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<h2><span class='special'>WebSite</span></h2>
			<p>Also the webpage you are seeing is another project. Inspired by different great webpages this website was born. Also it was from scratch by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am actively adding features to the webpage by the day. It is also hosted on github which can be found <a href="https://www.github.com/vaskar-gorai/webpage" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<h2><span class="special">Other Skills</span></h2>
			<p>I have learned about Artificial Intelligence and built neural networks to recognize the handwritten digits and characterize the traffic networks signals. It is really interesting how the computer can learn like human brain. I am learning more about topic as of this moment.</p>
